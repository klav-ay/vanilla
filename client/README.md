## Vision & Vibe

- **The Feeling:** We want users to feel like creative wizards. They come with an idea (or just a vague mood) and leave with a beautiful, personalized calendar that sparks joy or perfectly serves its function. It should feel less like work and more like playful co-creation with an AI muse.
- **Core Purpose:** To democratize beautiful calendar design through intuitive AI, making personalization seamless and the output high-quality for both digital viewing and physical printing.
- **Elevator Pitch:** Think "Canva meets Midjourney, but hyper-focused on beautiful, printable calendars you design by describing your vibe."

## Target User Vibe (Persona: "Creative Casey")

- **Who:** Digitally savvy individual (hobbyist, parent, student, small business owner) who appreciates aesthetics but isn't a professional graphic designer. They value personalization for gifts, planning, or decor.
- **Frustrations:** Generic templates feel boring. Pro design tools are overkill and intimidating. Getting visuals just right is hard.
- **Motivations:** Wants unique, beautiful outputs with minimal hassle. Excited by AI potential if it's easy and fun. Values high-quality print results.

**Key User Goals:**

- Easily create a calendar that looks amazing.
- Incorporate personal events/dates simply.
- Generate unique visuals without needing external tools or skills.
- Get a print-ready file (PDF) or digital image (PNG).
- Feel proud of the result.

## Core Epics & Feature Vibes (Frontend)

**(Epic 1)** Calendar Foundation Vibe - "Solid & Dependable":

- Select year/month(s), standard grid/list layouts, basic regional holiday sets, simple manual event input.

**(Epic 2)** GenAI Magic Vibe - "Inspiring & Wow!":

- Generate unique background/header images via text prompts ("watercolor forest in winter").
- Get AI suggestions for themes, color palettes, font pairings based on prompts or images.
- Generate small decorative elements/icons.

**(Epic 3)** AI Assistant Vibe - "Helpful & Intuitive":

- Initiate calendar creation via description ("Make a minimalist photo calendar for my family using pics from this folder...").
- Refine the design via conversational feedback ("Make the text bigger," "Try a different background for March").

**(Epic 4)** Output & Persistence Vibe - "Tangible & Useful":

- Flawless PDF export (vector, print-ready).
- Crisp PNG export (digital use).
- Interactive online preview.
- Save/load projects within the app.

## Guiding Principles (Frontend)

- **Aesthetics First:** Prioritize visual appeal. Default outputs should look good. Beauty isn't an afterthought.
- **Simplicity & Flow:** Minimize cognitive load. Interactions should feel intuitive, almost invisible. Smooth transitions.
- **AI as Co-Pilot:** AI empowers and suggests, user guides and decides. Avoid AI feeling opaque or uncontrollable.
- **Personalization is Paramount:** The end product must feel uniquely tailored to the user's input and style.
- **Quality Output Matters:** Exports (especially PDF) must be high-resolution and print reliably. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG).

## Technology Vibe (Frontend)

- **Frontend:** Modern, component-based JS framework (React). Focus on a clean, responsive UI.
- **Generative AI:** Leverage best-in-class third-party APIs for core GenAI (image generation, possibly LLM for assistant). Build custom logic for agent orchestration and workflow, not foundational models.
- **PDF Generation:** Use a proven, robust library.

## Out of Scope (Frontend)

- Building foundational AI models in-house.
- Complex multi-user collaboration features.
- Direct e-commerce integration (selling designs/prints).
- Mobile-native applications (focus on responsive web).
- Advanced, granular layout customization tools (lean on AI suggestions within defined layout types first).
- Advanced photo editing capabilities.

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
